                <p>- A study involving 98 college students examined their emotional responses to primary and intermediate hues, as well as achromatic colors (white, gray, and black). The primary hues elicited the highest number of positive responses, particularly green, which was associated with relaxation and comfort. The color green-yellow had the fewest positive responses, often associated with sickness and disgust. Among achromatic colors, white received more positive responses, followed by black and gra.
                <br>
                <br>- The color-emotion associations varied with the hue. For instance, red was linked to excitement and also to aggressive emotions. Green was associated with positive emotions like refreshment and quietness, but also with negative feelings like tiredness and guilt. Light colors like yellow and blue were generally associated with positive emotions, whereas dark colors like black and gray were associated with negative emotions. However, cultural factors can influence these associations, as seen with the color black, which elicited both positive and negative responses in different cultural contexts.</p>
